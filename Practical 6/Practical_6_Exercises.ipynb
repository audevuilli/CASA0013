Do <i>not</i> think of Python's output as being 'maps' in the GIS sense, they are composed of 'patches' of color on abstract 'axes' that can use any arbitrary coordinate space. So colours are 'really' triplet (or quadruplet if you have alpha-blending transparency) values in the range 0.0-1.0. Annotations are then added in similarly abstract fashion.</div>\n",

This is also reliant on `matplotlib` and basically involves plotting items to _shared axes_ which is done by passing in `ax=<axis object>` to each `plot(...)`. By convention, if you only have a single figure (e.g. a single map) then you create an axis object and name it `ax` so you will see a lot of `ax=ax` code in graphing libraries, but `=ax` is just saying 'assign to the axis object that I created'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the axes are how you control what is shown, see if you can find out by Googling how to set the x- and y-limits on the map so that it shows only London and trims out the much larger area of water that is outside of the Greater London Authority. **As a rough guideline, this has the Easting range 501,000 to 563,000, and the Northing range 155,000 to 202,000.**\n",
