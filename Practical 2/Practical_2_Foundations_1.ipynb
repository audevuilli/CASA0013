    "## Task 7: Back to the Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's possible to investigate files using Python directly, it's much faster and more flexible to look at new data using the Terminal. This is a _lot_ to fit into one practical, so feel free to return to this task later in the week, but I'd like you to start exploring [this data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jreades/i2p/master/data/2020-08-24-sample-listings-simple.csv) using only the Terminal or Git Bash. The idea is to contrast the command line tools with Excel on a file that is _still manageable_ in Excel before we apply the same approach to a file that is no longer really manageable in Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the steps are:\n",
    "1. Download the file and ensure it's saved as CSV.\n",
    "2. Using the Terminal/Git Bash (which I'm going to call the **shell** from here on out) move it to a folder _beneath_ your Dockerfile or the place where you launched Jupyter (e.g. `mv ~/Downloads/2020-08-24-sample-listings-simple.csv ~/Documents/CASA/modules/`)\n",
    "3. Open it in Excel for reference\n",
    "4. Using the shell, produce the following statistics on the file:\n",
    "   - How many rows are in the data set?\n",
    "   - What are the names of the columns?\n",
    "   - How many 'Entire home/apt' listings are there?\n",
    "   - How many listings mention that they are 'large'?\n",
    "   - Which listing is for \\$798 a night?\n",
    "5. Compare your answers with what you'd get looking in Excel.\n",
    "   - If there are differences, can you explain them?"
